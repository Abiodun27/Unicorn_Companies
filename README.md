# Project Title
Data Analysis of Unicorn Companies dataset using SQL and Tableau

# Project Description, Introduction and Objective
In this project, data science & analytics skills were used to explore the data, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights. 
The dataset used was obtained from Kaggle, which includes columns such as 'Company', 'Valuation', 'Date_joined', 'Country', 'City', 'Industry',
'Investors', 'Founded_year', 'Total_raised', 'Financial_stage', 'Investors_count', 'Deal_terms'.

The Sales database was created in Postgresql with the table which contains the columns listed above. The data was inspected, so as to have an understanding of 
some of its features, check for missing values and duplicates. Analysis was then performed on the data by answering certain questions using SQL, followed by getting
more insight by visualization using Tableau. The following questions are answered during the analysis:

* Which country has companies with most valuation?
* What is the trend of valuation as at joined_date?
* What is the trend of total_raised funding as at joined_date?
* Which country has companies having highest total_raised funding?
* Which country has most industries?
* Which industry has the most valuation?
* What is the valuation as at founded year?
* What is the total_raised as at founded year?
* What is the company with most investors by industry?
